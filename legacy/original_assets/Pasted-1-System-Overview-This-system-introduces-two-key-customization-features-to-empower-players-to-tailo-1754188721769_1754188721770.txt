1. System Overview
This system introduces two key customization features to empower players to tailor their gameplay experience: UI Tab Reordering and Visual Theme Selection. The goal is to provide a more comfortable and personalized interface for every player.
2. UI Tab Reordering
This feature will allow players to change the order of the main tabs (Equipment, Inventory, Combat, etc.) to prioritize the screens they use most often.
 * Functionality:
   * Players will be able to click and drag the tab buttons in the main content panel to rearrange them into any order they prefer.
   * A subtle visual indicator will show where the tab will be placed as it's being dragged.
 * Persistence:
   * The player's custom tab order will be saved to their account settings.
   * The game will remember their layout every time they log in.
 * Implementation: This will be achieved using the native HTML Drag and Drop API, which is lightweight and efficient.
3. Visual Theme Selection
This feature will allow players to change the entire color scheme of the game's UI by cycling through a set of five professionally designed themes.
 * Functionality:
   * The "Change Theme" button in the Settings Tab will become fully functional.
   * Each click will cycle to the next available theme, instantly updating the entire UI's color palette.
 * Persistence: The player's chosen theme will be saved to their account settings.
 * Implementation: The system will work by changing the values of the CSS custom properties (variables) at the :root level. This is extremely efficient, as it allows us to change the entire game's look without reloading or rewriting any other CSS.
 * The Five Themes:
| Theme Name | Description | Key Colors |
|---|---|---|
| Molten Core (Default) | The current theme. A fiery, volcanic look with a focus on raw power. | Orange, Red, Dark Gray |
| Geminus Magi-Tech | The signature theme. A dark, futuristic, 'cyber-mystical' UI with glowing neon highlights. | Bright Cyan, Dark Glass, Black |
| Frostbite | A cold, icy theme with sharp, cool colors that evoke the feeling of a frozen wasteland. | Light Blue, Indigo, Dark Blue |
| Arcane Violet | A magical, ethereal theme with vibrant, mystical colors that feel otherworldly. | Purple, Magenta, Deep Indigo |
| Verdant Growth | An earthy, natural theme with forest-like colors, perfect for a more grounded fantasy feel. | Green, Lime, Dark Brown |
