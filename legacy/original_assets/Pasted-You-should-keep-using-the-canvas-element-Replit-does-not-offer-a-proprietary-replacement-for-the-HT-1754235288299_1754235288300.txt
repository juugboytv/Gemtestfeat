You should keep using the canvas element.
Replit does not offer a proprietary replacement for the HTML <canvas>. It is an online IDE and hosting environment that runs standard web code. Your game, Geminus, will be rendered in a web browser using the <canvas> element, whether you code it on Replit or locally.
The real question is not about Replit, but whether you should use the raw canvas API versus a game engine or library.
Raw Canvas API vs. Game Engine
For a project with the complexity of a dark fantasy RPG, using a game engine is the standard professional practice. Writing directly to the canvas API (e.g., ctx.fillRect(), ctx.drawImage()) requires you to build everything from scratch: the game loop, state management, sprite rendering, input handling, and physics.
Using a game engine provides significant advantages:
 * Abstraction: Simplifies complex rendering tasks into high-level commands.
 * Performance: Engines often have highly optimized rendering loops that can switch between Canvas 2D and WebGL for better performance.
 * Structure: Provides a framework for managing scenes, game objects (sprites), animations, and assets.
 * Features: Includes built-in tools for physics, particle effects, audio management, and input handling.
Recommended JavaScript Game Engines
Since you're building a 2D RPG, consider these popular engines. They all utilize the <canvas> element but handle the low-level implementation for you.
 * Phaser: A very powerful and mature 2D game framework. It has a massive community and extensive documentation, making it an excellent choice for a feature-rich RPG.
 * PixiJS: A lightweight but extremely fast 2D rendering engine. It focuses purely on graphics, giving you more control than a full framework like Phaser. You would pair it with other libraries for physics or state management.
 * Kaboom.js: Popular on Replit for its simplicity and fun approach to game development. It may be too basic for a complex "dark fantasy" RPG but is great for rapid prototyping.
Recommendation: Keep the <canvas> element in your index.html. Select a game engine like Phaser to manage your game logic and rendering onto that canvas. This will save you significant development time and allow you to focus on building the features of Geminus.
