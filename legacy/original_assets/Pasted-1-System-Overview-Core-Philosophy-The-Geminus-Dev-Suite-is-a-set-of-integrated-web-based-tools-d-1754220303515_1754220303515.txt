1. System Overview & Core Philosophy
The Geminus Dev Suite is a set of integrated, web-based tools designed to give non-coding developers full control over all in-game content. The suite will be accessible through a special "Dev Tools" button in the Settings tab, protected by an admin password.
Core Principles:
 * Visual & Intuitive: All editors will be visual, using dropdown menus, sliders, and clickable interfaces instead of raw data entry wherever possible.
 * Data-Driven: The tools will directly edit the game's central database (e.g., MongoDB). Changes made in the Dev Suite will be reflected in the live game after a server reboot or a "hot-load" command.
 * Error Prevention: The tools will use strict validation to prevent invalid data. For example, a designer won't be able to assign a "Sword" to a "Helmet" slot.
