This error occurs because the code is attempting to execute this.ctx.clearRect(...), but this.ctx is null. This means the canvas 2D rendering context was not successfully assigned to the ctx property of your object or class before the rendering/clearing function was called.
The most common cause is that the JavaScript code responsible for initialization runs before the <canvas> element has been rendered in the Document Object Model (DOM).
Solution: Ensure Initialization After DOM Load
You must initialize the canvas context only after the DOM is fully loaded. You can achieve this using a DOMContentLoaded event listener in vanilla JavaScript or a
lifecycle hook like useEffect in a framework like React.
Vanilla JavaScript Fix
Wrap your canvas initialization logic in an event listener to ensure the ‹canvas> element exists before your script tries to access it.

javascript
// Assumes your HTML has: ‹canvas id="gameCanvas">/canvas>
class Game {
constructor (canvasid) ‹
this. canvas = null;
this.ctx = null;
// Defer initialization until the DOM is ready
document. addEventListener ( 'DOMContentLoaded', () =>
this. init (canvasId);
this.draw(); // Example draw call
}) ;
}
init (canvasId) {
this. canvas = document. getElementById(canvasId) ;
if (this. canvas) {
// This is the critical step that was likely
failing or running too early
this.ctx = this.canvas. getContext ('2d');
} else {
console.error ( 'Canvas element not found!');
}
}
clear () {
// This
check prevents the error if
initialization failed
if (!this.ctx) return;
// Now this.ctx is guaranteed to be a valid
context object
this.ctx.clearRect(0, 0, this.canvas.width,
this. canvas.height);
draw() {
this. clear ();
// ... your drawing logic here ...
// Instantiate your game
const myGame = new Game (' gameCanvas ');

React.js Fix
If you are using React for your game Ul, use the useRef and useEffect hooks to manage the canvas element and its context. This is the standard approach for interacting with DOM elements in React.
jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
const GameCanvas = () => {
// Create a ref to hold the canvas DOM element
const canvasRef = useRef (null);
// useEffect runs after the component mounts, so the
canvas element will exist useEffect ( () → {
const canvas = canvasRef. current;
if (!canvas) return;
// Get the context from the canvas
element
const ctx = canvas. getContext ('2d');
// Drawing logic
const draw = () = {
// Clear the canvas
ctx. clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height) ;
// Your drawing code here
ctx.fillStyle =
'red';
ctx. fillRect (10, 10, 50, 50) ;
｝i
draw() ;
// Clean up if the component unmounts
// return () = { /* cleanup logic */ };
}, []); // The empty dependency array Il ensures this
runs only once
return <canvas ref={canvasRef} width="800"
height="600" />;
} ;
export default GameCanvas;

By implementing either of these patterns, you guarantee that this.ctx (or ctx) is a valid rendering context before any drawing or clearing methods are called on it, thus resolving the null is not an object error.
