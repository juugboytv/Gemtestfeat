✅ 1. MAIN GAME FILE IDENTIFIED

The currently running game is served through React + Vite:

📌 Main Entry Point:
client/src/components/GeminusGame.tsx

This is embedded in:

client/src/App.tsx

Served via:

server/index.ts + server/vite.ts
→ serves client/index.html
→ loads the React app (GeminusGame.tsx)

📦 2. Recommended Folder Structure

Here’s how you should organize everything for a clean, production-ready setup:

📁 root/
│
├── index.html                # Optional static entry (likely unused now)
├── exact_original.html       # Preserved original Gemini canvas game code
├── postcss.config.js
├── tailwind.config.ts
├── vite.config.ts
├── drizzle.config.ts
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── README.md
├── replit.md
│
├── client/                   # React frontend
│   ├── index.html            # Used by Vite (root div)
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── App.tsx
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   └── GeminusGame.tsx  # Main game component
│   │   ├── assets/              # Static images, fonts, etc.
│   │   └── styles/              # Tailwind or additional CSS files
│   └── gameAPI.js              # Client JS API support
│
├── server/                   # Express backend
│   ├── index.ts              # Main server file
│   └── vite.ts               # Vite server integration
│
├── js/                       # Legacy JS files (optional, or move into client/src/utils)
├── shared/                   # Shared interfaces or types
├── D_attached_assets/        # External or uploaded assets
├── style.css                 # (If still in use, move to client/src/styles)
├── script.js / temp_script.js # (Move to js/ or delete if unused)
├── temp_zones_35_to_101.txt  # Development notes or data
└── components.json           # (If config, move to root or shared/)

🔍 3. What You Can Clean Up

If index.html, script.js, style.css aren’t referenced by your React/Vite build — move them to /legacy/ or delete them.

Use /client/src/assets for all images, sounds, maps, etc.

Move any remaining JS utility files into /client/src/utils.

🛠️ How to Tell Replit or Collaborators:

Copy-paste this:

> "Please organize the project using a modern structure:
Move React components to /client/src/components, assets to /client/src/assets, and all original Gemini game HTML files to a /legacy folder.
Confirm GeminusGame.tsx is the main entry point served by Vite through client/index.html.
Move old script.js, style.css, etc. to /legacy if unused, or refactor into the new React structure if still relevant."
